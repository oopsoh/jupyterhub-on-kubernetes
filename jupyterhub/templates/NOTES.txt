Thank you for installing JupyterHub!

Your release is named {{.Release.Name}} and installed into the namespace {{.Release.Namespace}}.

You can find if the hub and proxy is ready by doing:

 kubectl --namespace={{.Release.Namespace}} get pod

and watching for both those pods to be in status 'Ready'.

You can find the public IP of the JupyterHub by doing:

 kubectl --namespace={{.Release.Namespace}} get svc proxy-public

It might take a few minutes for it to appear!

Note that this is still an alpha release! If you have questions, feel free to
